Pythonâ€™s use in web development is facilitated by frameworks such as Django and Flask. These tools simplify the process of building robust web applications. With Django, developers can create scalable and secure websites quickly, while Flask provides flexibility for lightweight and customizable projects. The availability of third-party libraries further enhances Python's capability in web development. For instance, developers can easily integrate authentication systems, databases, and APIs into their applications.
