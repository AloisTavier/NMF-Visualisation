Sushi is a healthy and nutrient-rich meal when prepared with fresh ingredients. The combination of rice, fish, and vegetables provides a balanced intake of carbohydrates, protein, and essential vitamins. For instance, raw fish like salmon and tuna are excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which support heart and brain health. Vegetarian options such as cucumber and avocado rolls offer a delicious alternative for those who prefer plant-based diets. With low calorie counts and high nutritional value, sushi is both a tasty and wholesome choice.
