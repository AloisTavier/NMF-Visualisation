Sushi restaurants, or sushi-ya, are popular dining destinations across the globe. Traditional sushi-ya in Japan often serve sushi directly at the counter, where chefs prepare it in front of customers. This creates a personal and immersive dining experience. Modern sushi restaurants have embraced conveyor belt systems, or kaitenzushi, allowing diners to pick their favorite dishes as they pass by. Whether enjoyed in a fine-dining establishment or a casual eatery, sushi continues to delight food lovers everywhere.
